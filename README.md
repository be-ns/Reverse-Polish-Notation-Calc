# Reverse-Polish-Notation-Calc
This is a RPN calculator implemented in Python using OOP. 

Iterations to be saved for clarity in interaction and expended math functions. 

Future work could include implementing complex mathmatical functions and expressions.

Say we want to calculate the value resulting from the calculation: `6 + ((5 + 3) / 4) - 3`. In RPN, that calculation is written: `6 5 3 + 4 / + 3 âˆ’`. To input this calculation into a RPN calculator, one would enter those elements (in turn), and the corresponding operations would occur in the following order.


| Input |  Operation   |    Stack    |                   Other                   |
|:-----:|:------------:| ----------- |:-----------------------------------------:|
|   6   |  Push Value  | [ 6 ]       |                                           |
|   5   |  Push Value  | [ 6, 5 ]    |                                           |
|   3   |  Push Value  | [ 6, 5, 3 ] |                                           |
|   +   |     Add      | [ 6, 8 ]    | Pop two values (3 then 5), push result, 8 |
|   4   |  Push Value  | [ 6, 8, 4 ] |                                           |
|   /   |    Divide    | [ 6, 2 ]    | Pop two values (8 then 4), push result, 2 |
|   +   |     Add      | [ 8 ]       | Pop two values (2 then 6), push result, 8 |
|   3   |  Push Value  | [ 8, 3 ]    |                                           |
|   -   |   Subtract   | [ 5 ]       | Pop two values (3 then 8), push result  5 |
|       |    Return    |   5         |                                           |

__note__  
If you wanted to do 5 + 5 + 5 you'd do 5 5 5 + + __not__ 5 5 5 +
